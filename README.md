## About

This paper reports on a mixed-method survey on the practices and needs concerning Collaborative MDSE in industry. First, we carried out a qualitative survey in two focus group sessions, interviewing seven industry experts. Second, based on the results of the interviews, we have constructed a questionnaire and carried out a questionnaire survey with 41 industry expert participants.

## Contents

This repository contains data sets, analysis scripts, raw results, and transcripts of the focus group discussions.

### Transcripts
* `/01_transcripts` – Anonymized transcripts of the focus group sessions.

### Classification framework
* `/02_classification_framework` – Classification framework and definitions of terms.

### Questionnaire
* `/03_questionnaire`
   * `Questionnaire.pdf` – The questionnaire used in the online survey.
   * `Collaborative Model-Driven Software Engineering – An Overview.pdf` – The overview the participants were provided with.

### Data

* `/04_data` – Raw data and data preparation scripts.
   * `/questionnaire` – Raw data in `.xlsx` with the sensitive information removed.
   * `/studies` – Data collected from the replication packages of the systematic mapping studies [1] and [2].
      *  `/01_original_2016.xlsx` – Original data from [1].
      *  `/02_extension_to_orignial_2021.xlsx` – Extension to `01_original_2016.xlsx` collected in [2].
      *  `/03_update_2021.xlsx` – Original data from [2] augmenting the classification framework of [1] with new categories.
      *  `/04_extension_to_original_2022.xlsx` – Extracted data for the current study. These categories were introduced in [2] but were not extracted for [1] retrospectively.
   * `00_remove_sensitive_information.py` – Removes sensitive information from `questionnaire/questionnaire_data_raw.xlsx` and saves the clean data in `questionnaire/questionnaire_data.xlsx`. (The `questionnaire/questionnaire_data_raw.xlsx` file is removed from the final public package.)
   * `01_prepare_data.py` – Pre-processes questionnaire data for the analysis of demographics (and outputs `demographics_data.csv`) and for the analysis of the RQs (and outputs `questionnaire_data.csv`). Consolidates data from the studies (and outputs `studies/studies_data.xlsx`). Pre-processes consolidated studies data for RQ4 (and outputs `studies_data.csv`).
   * `demographics_data.csv` – Data file containing the demographics of participants.
   * `questionnaire_data.csv` – Data file containing pre-processed and cleaned questionnaire data.
   * `studies_data.csv` – Data file containing data about academic output.

### Analysis scripts

* `/05_analysis` – Analysis scripts.
   * `01_analysis_participant_demographics.py` – Charts of some demographic and descriptive statistics of the participants, their companies, the tools used, model sizes, etc.
   * `02_generate_latex_tables.py` – Generates LaTeX tables used in the paper. The `/template` folder contains the LaTeX template.
   * `03_analysis_RQs.R` – .R script for analyzing the RQs. Produces Likert plots, need-adoption matrices, and Excel reports into folder `/06_output`.

### Results

Upon running the analysis scripts, the following directory structure is produced. (New runs of the script will remove the previously generated folders.)
* `/06_output`
   * `/aggregated` – Aggregated descriptive statistics of the three dimensions.
      * `/xlsx/Aggregated.xlsx` – Adoption and needs aggregated over every feature group, in an Excel table for allowing further inspection and exploration.
      * `/xlsx/Studies.xlsx` – Publication output and needs aggregated over every feature group, in an Excel table for allowing further inspection and exploration.
   * `/demographics` – Demographic statistics of the participants, their companies, the tools used, model sizes, etc.
   * `/likert` – Likert charts in PDF files with the adoption-need pairs of feature groups charted next to each other.
   * `/likert-annotated` – Likert charts annotated with feature labels.
   * `/tables` – LaTeX tables used in the paper.

## Reproduction
Install Python requirements before running the scripts by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root folder.

* [Reproduction of the analyses](#reproduction-of-the-analyses): reproduces the analysis results in `/04_results`, including charts and numeric results. The scripts use the prepared data contained in the `/01_data/prepared` folder.
* [Reproduction of the prepared data](#reproduction-of-the-prepared-data): reproduces the prepared data in `/01_data/prepared` by (i) merging author, transaction and file length metadata into the clone data; and (ii), pre-processing data for analysis and persisting the pre-processed data into pickle files. Some of the pre-processing steps are potentially time-consuming. In such cases, the approximate execution times are reported in the source file.

**NOTE:** The following steps have been tested with `python>=3.7 && python<3.10` and `R version 4.2.2`.

### Reproduction of the analyses

Follow the steps below to reproduce the analysis results in `/06_results`.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root folder.
3. Run `python 01_analysis_participant_demographics.py` in the `/05_analysis` folder to obtain demographics results.
4. Run `python 02_generate_latex_tables.py` in the `/05_analysis` folder to obtain LaTeX tables reporting on results.
5. Run `03_analysis_RQs.R` (e.g., from [R Studio](https://rstudio.cloud/)) in the `/05_analysis` folder to obtain the Likert charts and the aggregated results in Excel sheets under `/aggregated`.

### Reproduction of the prepared data

Follow the steps below to reproduce the prepared data in `/04_data`.

1. Run `python 01_prepare_data.py` in the `/04_data` folder to obtain the following data files:
   1. `demographics_data.csv` – demographics data for later analysis.
   2. `questionnaire_data.csv` – questionnaire data for RQs 1–3.
   3. `studies_data.xlsx` – consolidated studies data for RQ4.
